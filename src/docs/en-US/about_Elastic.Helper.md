# Elastic.Helper

## about_Elastic.Helper

### SHORT DESCRIPTION

A PowerShell Helper Module to interface to ElasticSearch

### LONG DESCRIPTION

Interfacing to ElasticSearch is complex. Even with the Elastic.Console module.  This module solves some problems for me in publishing resources to ElasticSearch.

This includes:

* Ingest Pipelines
* Enrichment Policies
* Index Properties
* Bulk Index requests

This module supports both Authenticated and Unauthenticated connections to ElasticSearch.  Which mode you use depends on your ElasticSearch implementation.
